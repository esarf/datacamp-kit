In this challenge we aimed to predict the rent amount in Paris thanks to diverse data such as schools, crimes or event the previous rents. This could become a tool for real estate agent or for owners in order to fix a good renting price. 

Installation: 
 - install `ramp-workflow` library 
 - `$ pip install git+https://github.com/LoicJOURDAN/DataCamp.git`
 
 Testing the predictions locally:  
 Once in the good folder run:
  `ramp-test --submission = starting_kit`
  
 For a quicker test:
 
`ramp-test --submission = starting_kit --quick-test `

Eventually, the notebook might not display correctly due to its size and the interactive plots we put in it. Then to see it properly, do :  
- go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org  
- copy paste the link you have to the `starting-kit.ipynb` on the webpage  
- enjoy!
