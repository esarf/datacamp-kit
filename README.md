**Authors** : Selma Bouchta, Ryan Boustany, Paul Couairon, Loïc Jourdan, Emma Sarfati  
**Teachers** : Alexandre Gramfort (*INRIA*), Thomas Moreau (*INRIA*)  

In this challenge we aimed to predict the rent amount in Paris thanks to diverse data such as schools, crimes or event thdata and the challenge is available [here](https://github.com/esarf/datacamp-loyers/blob/main/starting_kit.ipynb).

## Installation: 
 - install `ramp-workflow` library 
 - run `$ pip install git+https://github.com/esarf/datacamp-loyers.git`
 
## Testing the predictions locally:  

 Once in the good folder, run:  
  `ramp-test --submission = starting_kit`
  
 Or for a quicker test, run:  
 `ramp-test --submission = starting_kit --quick-test `

Eventually, the notebook might not display correctly due to its size and the interactive plots we put in it. Then to see it properly, you can either git clone the repo and run it locally, or do :  
- go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org  
- copy paste the link you have to the `starting-kit.ipynb` on the webpage  
- enjoy!
